9,"M1 Garand Safety? How do you turn on/off the safety on a M1 Garand? The M-1 Garand has a safety lever, inside the trigger guard.  It also has a hole in it to place a padlock for additional safety and security!  By pushing the safety back, it prevents the trigger from activating.  Like any semi-automatic weapon that is kept loaded, the safest method is to keep the chamber empty, as this will prevent accidental discharge in the event the weapon is dropped.\n\nTo re-activate the weapon for action, simply reverse the position from the safety position."

The Palestinians have elected a government that follows an official policy of terror.  This incident is intolerable - time to take action. Israel was invaded by Palestinians in this attack.  Israel has been under almost constant bombardment since leaving Gaza.  Israel has the right to defend itself when attacked.  This response is way overdue.
