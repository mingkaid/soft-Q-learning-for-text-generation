If your breathing is improper it could result in faster fatigue and lazy feet.

This means your opponents mechanics will breakdown first because he will get tired before you, sometimes due just to proper breathing."

Back in my day as a budding mathematician (1960's and 70's) 1 place precision meant that you could only 'trust' the answer to one digit.\n\nFor example, 'What is 132 / 12?'  The answer is 11.  But using one place precision, it would be 'about 10'.  \n\nAn alternate definition would be to be accurate to 1 decimal place.  What is 'pi'.  The answer is 3.14159...  However, to only one decimal place it is '3.1'"

Bones of related land-dwelling creatures were also found on the coastlines of the two distant continents."
